## Hoe to use the code:
Code is done in java languages. Using Swing to create a window based application 

## Inspiration:
Creating the nostalgic game that we used to play in our childhood to re experince those memories, As everyone has played it and loved it in their childhood.

## What it does:
This application is game that allow user to control the snakes movement who wants to eat food to get bigger in length, here the objective is to get as bigger as possible meanwhie snake mouth should not touch its own body or it will kill himself and the game will over.


## How I built it:
I built the frame using java Swing, added a Game pannel in it where the game will be live and a score board to get the user updated by his current score , added the controls of snakes movement by taking users keyboard input .

## Challenges we ran into:
Understanding the concepts of Java Swing, Visulaizing the Gprahical interface and implimenting the design 

## Accomplishments that I am proud of:
This application is able to simmulate the Snake game taht we used to play just By using java language

## What I learned:
I learned how to create a window appplication using java and apply those concept in a game 

## What's next for Air Quality Tracker:
In coming days, I will add few new features like Pause-Resume, highscore list by adding Database, better user interface etc.
